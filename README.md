# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

In this module, we analyzed various cryptocurrencies that are currently trading. We took data from CryptoCompare, preprocessed it in order to prepare it for unsupervised machine learning. We will be performed PCA analysis, predicted clusters, and finally plotted our results.

All of our plots and charts associated with this project are in the Crypto_Challenge.ipynb
